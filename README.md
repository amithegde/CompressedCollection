Welcome to CompressedCollection
=============================

This is a POC to show how a collection which contains objects with repeating string property values can be compressed in memory for purposes such as caching.

Written in C#.

Typical Usecases:
---------------------
- While caching a large collection in memory for repeated access
- While caching a large collection in some sort of persistent cache such as a file/blob

Feel free to fork and use the code... :)
